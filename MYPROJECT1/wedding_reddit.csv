The only people who know are our witnesses - we‚Äôre not telling anyone else in case our original plans still work out. But I guess I‚Äôm telling all of Reddit instead. While the world is melting down around us, we chose love.

Edit: I‚Äôve offended quite a few people by putting this as a confession. I guess I figured if our families found out and close friends, they‚Äôd be upset they couldn‚Äôt be there.

I'm a long-time lurker on the subreddit--frigging love this community and all of Wildbow's work.

So as the title implies, I got hitched today! In honour of the day, I was thinking of offering this subreddit a challenge :

Write a trigger event, which is caused either by a wedding or a marriage :D. Bonus points will be rewarded if you or someone else can also create a power from the trigger event.

I'll pick my favourites by tomorrow evening at this time--and here are the categories I'll be picking :

-Most twisted and f***ed up
-Most romantic... Up until the trigger event
-Most depressingly realistic
-Most toxic co-dependent relationship 
-Most disappointing 

Have fun guys :)",2020,3,13,02:07:59,during_lockdown

I honestly don't know what to say - I'm in a bit of shock currently. We've been friends for around 14 years (both currently 25) and have never been apart since. We've shared ups, downs, highs, lows, the works. Her family's never been the biggest fan of me (they're Christian and thought I was trying to convert my friend to Paganism) but still treated me with respect, I did the same. We were both engaged and I always thought we'd be at each other's weddings to support the other... but I guess not.

I found out she got married today through a video her mother posted of the ceremony on Facebook - she had friends and family present, and it was very sweet to watch (small, intimate ceremony). I just finished watching it and I feel like the wind's been knocked out of me... we saw each other only a few days ago and she never brought up the upcoming marriage at all. I thought I meant enough to her that she'd want me with her on one of the most important days of her life but apparently that wasn't the case. No one else has stuck with me through my severe depression and I'm so introverted that I have no other friends. I don't know... this is just killing me inside. I feel worthless right now. We're currently chatting about her wedding but I'm too scared to ask why I wasn't invited as I don't want to ruin her post-wedding happiness.

Thanks for letting me vent, guys. I'm really overwhelmed right how and want to cry. Guess she didn't want the ""sad one"" there, even though I still want her at my wedding. Is that wrong? I don't want to lose her, even after this.",2020,3,10,12:07:31,during_lockdown

However she did have 2 boyfriends before me. One was our teams runningback and it was well known he had a big one and had been with a few girls and it was no secret he had a big dick. and She had given him oral sex a couple times but she found out he was cheating so they broke up so she had experience seeing a big dick, I also knew how terrible I compared after catching a glimpse one time after football practice.

But the part that always killed me was her other boyfriend that she dated for a month or so. While drunk at a party she has gotten the chance to feel his dick and see it and his was small as well. she laughed at it super hard and told everyone. and the couple times she had saw it she would relay to me all the time how pathetic he was, and even during games of beer pong when you would ask to rearrange the cups instead of saying the ""I formation"" when 2 cups were left she would say the ""ryan formation"" cause of the 2 cup making a small like like a small dick was. but she would often say stuff and it would kill me like one time we were driving and had friends in the car and another guy got road rage at us and she would go ""he prob has a super small dick"" and everyone else would laugh and I would to only to play along with it.

When we were wasted and making out (we did makeout all the time but she was one of those girls who wouldnt go further until it had been a bit) she started to feel down my area and my dick was hanging off to the left and she was on the right side and didnt feel it right away and said some shit like ""umm do you even have anything here and giggled"" luckily by the grace of god someone came knocking at the door in the room and came in because they wanted to have sex in there so we got up and she was wasted enough I dont think she even remembered it.

But that was enough right there where I had to find a way to end things. Was senior year of high school and I didnt want to be laughed at every single day like ryan was. so I had to tell her I just wanted to be friends because I had known her for real long and liked her more as a friend. it fucking killed me. everyone else was shocked to and my friends thought I was a lunatic because she was one of the hottest girls in school, and she was also perfect for me we were such great friends and had so many common interests she was one of my best friends and i fucking loved her. Just couldnt deal with the let down and couldnt deal with the shame of her laughing at it and it getting out how small I wise, killed me to think of how much smaller I was than the previous guy she was with. and again I had to make up some BS to my friends and others that I just liked her as a friend, and my friends were so shocked because it was rare a girl that hot to still be a virgin and they would tell me the chance I was blowing to ""take it"" from her and I was a fuck up for not doing it.

She was ehart broken about it and didnt know what she did wrong and didnt talk to me the final few months of the year and that summer she wouldnt go to any of the parties i was at and then we went to different colleges, and it would kill me to go on facebook and see she had a new bf so I just deleted it all together to not go through the pain, while in college I also made excuses to dodge so many other girls in fear of getting laughed at

and a few days  ago everything hit me like a ton of bricks, she was engaged and getting married. and I still fucking love her and she was perfect for me, only ask myself over and over why was I cursed like this? i lose someone I love so much who I would have a perfect life with all because of what i was dealt down low, would never find a girl so perfect for me again. i sometimes still wish i could go back in time and if she denied me and laughed at my dick so be it if I was a joke but at least I would have given it a chance, but I still dont think id have the balls to do it. just wanted to vent how much this kills me",2020,2,1,06:58:02,before_lockdown

He was a lot of my firsts, my first kiss, date, kiss, first time, all of it. I was head over heels with this guy at the time and right before we celebrated a year together we broke up. He was moving to another city and it was rare that I saw him outside of school because his parents were so strict. 

I didn't have contact with him for a while after that because of some drama that went down right before he moved, so I didn't say goodbye when he left. I sent him a message about a year later after I saw a missing poster for him, he had run away from home because his family had been beating him. I asked him if he was okay and we talked for a while. My mom always liked him and we were planning a move across the country (didn't end up happening.) My mom and I decided to invite him to come with us when he turned 18 so he could have a better chance away from the family that hurt him so bad. 

Since the move didn't happen he went down south a few hours and went through a few girls. I wasn't too worried about it, I didn't have any feelings for him anymore so I was just doing my own thing. Around March of my Junior year, he had broken up with this girl for faking a pregnancy and we started talking again. Talking enough that I invited him to my Prom. He didn't show and didn't say a word to me for a year and a half. 

Now he has a son, and another baby on the way. He got married today to another girl. I'm happy for him, but I felt a little jab to my heart. I can honestly say that I don't have feelings for him and I hope they are happy together for their sake, and their children's. 

Anyway, I just kinda wanted to get that out.",2020,2,2,10:09:24,before_lockdown
